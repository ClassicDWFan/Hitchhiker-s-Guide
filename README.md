# Hitchhiker-s-Guide
4th Year Apple Mac Programming project

This application was created as part of the Apple Mac Programming module for the fourth and final year of my Applied Computing course.

The idea for it came from my admiration of the works of Douglas Adams, and in particular, The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, and how the concept for that has found its way into many online websites and institutuions we use everyday, from Google to Wikipedia.

The app was created as an advanced version of a simple soundboard, a soundboard being a simple app whereby you press a button and a soundfile plays. As this is meant to showcase text entries as well as soundfiles, the sounds are set up to play when the specific View Controller containing the entry is brought up by pressing the coresponding button.
